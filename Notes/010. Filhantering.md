## Path (Class)
Does operations on strings that contains path or directory path information. Cross-platform.

Only handles strings.

It's a good idea to use relative paths, since they will work cross-platform.
```c#
//Returns full path
Path.GetFullPath(newPath)
//Returns name of file(with extension) or folder
Path.GetFileName(newPath)
//Returns filename without extension
Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(newPath)
//Returns extension
Path.GetExtension(newPath)
//Returns path to directory
Path.GetDirectoryName(newPath)
//Returns root in path
Path.GetPathRoot(newPath)
//Returns true if path exists
Path.Exists(newPath)
```
## Directory (Class)

Methods for creating, moving and enumerating through directories.

```c#
//Returns path to current directory
Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()

string folderPath = "Path";
//Returns string array with all files in directory
string[] files = Directory.GetFiles(folderPath);
//Writes all filenames
foreach (string file in files)
{
    Console.WriteLine(Path.GetFileName(file));
}
//Returns string array with all directories in directory
string[] directories = Directory.GetDirectories(folderPath);
//Writes all directories
foreach (string directory in directories)
{
    Console.WriteLine(Path.GetFileName(directory));
}
//Path
string newFolder = Path.Combine(folderPath, "NewFolder", "Test1", "Test2");

//Creates directory if it doesn't exist including the ones up to the end of path
Directory.CreateDirectory(newFolder);

//Deletes empty directory
Directory.Delete(newFolder);
```
## File (Class)
Provides methos for creation, copying, deletion, moving and opening of a single file

## StreamWriter (Class)
Makes a TextWriter for writing characters to a stream in a particular encoding.

Stream represents bytes.

The stream can be a filestream which means it writes to a file

```c#
//Makes a new file each time the StreamWRiter is created
StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter("myfile.txt");
//If file exists, appends when true. if false = will write over file.
StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter("myfile.txt", true);
//Writes to file
writer.WriteLine("Hello World!");

//Clears the buffer every time a write is run.
writer.AutoFlush = true;
//Clears the buffer
writer.Flush();

//Dispose = Used to release resources, drops the stream, removes the object. Can't use writer after this, unless a new one is created.
writer.Dispose();

//Using = Uses a object that can be disposed. After the block has run, the obect and variable will be disposed.
using (StreamWriter writer1 = new StreamWriter("myfile.txt"))
{
    writer1.WriteLine("Rad1");
    writer1.WriteLine("Rad2");
}

```

## StreamReader (Class)

Makes a TextReader for reading text data.

```c#
using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader("myfile.txt"))
{
    //One way of looping through text
    while (!reader.EndOfStream)
    {
        Console.Write((char)reader.Read());
        Thread.Sleep(50);
    }
    //Method that does it for you
    Console.Write(reader.ReadToEnd());
}
```

## FileStream

Used for reading/writing binary data to/from file

```c#
using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead("L010_FileStream.exe"))
{
	//stream.Length returns byte array with number of bytes in stream
    Console.WriteLine(stream.Length);
	
    byte[] data = new byte[stream.Length];
    //reads all the bytes in byte array
    stream.Read(data);
	//Writes the first hunder bytes as hexadecimals
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    {
        Console.Write($"{data[i].ToString("X2")} ");
    }
}
```

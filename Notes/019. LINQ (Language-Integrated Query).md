# 019. LINQ (Language-Integrated Query)

A .NET component adding data querying capabilities to .NET languages, partly by providing extension methods on the IEnumerable interface for standard query operators like filtering, sorting, grouping and aggregation.

A way to work with databases, without writing SQL(?)


## Two different ways to do this

Querys doesn't execute until forced by example ToList(), they are more of a method that will run when needed.

### Extension methods - Method syntax

```c#
//Using LINQ to separate strings from list

List<string> stringList2 = objectList.OfType<string>().ToList();

//Fun way of showing content in list
Console.WriteLine("stringList2 content:");
Console.WriteLine(string.Join('\n', stringList2));

//Any() - Returns true if there are any elements in the collection
stringList2.Any();
//Any(Func<t, bool> predicate) - Returns true if there is an element that satisfies a condition in collection
stringList2.Any(s => s.Length == 5);

//Where
//Filter collection by returning an IEnumerable with all elements that satisfy condition

//Creates new List<string> with all strings that are 5 characters long.
var stringList3 = stringList2.Where(s => s.Length == 5);

//Select
//Transfrom objects

var people = new[] {
    new {LastName = "Björnsson", FirstName = "Björn", Age = 39},
    new {LastName = "Rafaelsson", FirstName = "Rafael", Age = 40},
    new {LastName = "Pellesson", FirstName = "Pelle", Age = 39}
}.ToList();

//Makes a new list with selected properties
//Overload, (object, position in list)
var people2 = people.Select((p, i) => new { Number = i, Name = $"{p.FirstName} {p.LastName}", Age = p.Age, Email = $"{p.FirstName.Title()}.{p.LastName.ToLower()}.gmail.com" }).ToList();

//Linq method chaining
var people3 = people
    .Where(p => p.Age >= 40)
    .Select((p, i) => new 
    { Number = i, 
      Name = $"{p.FirstName} {p.LastName}", 
      Email = $"{p.FirstName.Title()}.{p.LastName.ToLower()}.gmail.com" })
    .Where(p => p.Number >= 0)
    .ToList();

```


### Query syntax - .Net keywords
With LINQ Microsoft introduced certain keywords to C#, making it possible to write type-checked SQL-like queries integrated directly in the language.
LINQ queries can be used on various sources, like XML, RDB;S, and ADO.NET

from, select, where

```c#
//Query Syntax

//from (iterator) in (collection) (selection) where (projection) select 
var query = from p in people where p.Age >= 40 select p.Age;

//Method equivalent
var methodSyntax = people.Where(p => p.Age >= 40).Select(p => p.Age);

foreach (var age in query)
{
    Console.WriteLine(age);
}
```

## Yield and deferred execution
Query operations doesn't execute until forced by example ToList method.

# 8. Exceptions
Runtime error gives you an exception. Something that the program wasn't planned for and can't keep on running.

Default exception handler - Writes out the exception and shuts down application.

## Try, catch, finally blocks
C# has a built in toolset to work with exceptions.
### try
Any line of codes that may raise an exception should be put in a try-block.
Try must always have a catch, or finally.

If something in the try-block gets an exception, the try block breaks and the catch or finally block will run instead.

When an exception is thrown, the exception will follow the call stack and get caught by the first catch that handles the exception.
### catch

A try can have more than one catch. 
Catch can take an exception data type as parameter which has a lot of properties. The catch block will run if the exception given as parameter is raised in the try block.
### finally 
Always runs. What you want to do with the finally block is to free up resources. Ex: Close file, shut down connection to server et. c.
### Exception Class: 
Every exception has an unique data type.

**Exception is pretty slow, so exceptions should be used only for exceptional things, not standard cases.** 

#### Properties
1. .Message = Returns string that tells us which exception it was.
2. .StackTrace = Returns string that tells us where the exception was caught. Gives info about the current call stack that called on the exception.

#### throw-keyword
Throws exception. Useful for example logging all exceptions thrown by the program. Can also create new exceptions.

throw; = Can only be used inside a catch block. 
throw new FileNotFoundException();

## Syntax example 
``` c#
static void MyFunction()
{
    int[] myArray = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    myArray[4] = 0;
}

try
{
    int x = 0;
    int y = 1 / x;

    MyFunction();
    Int32.Parse("Hej");

    Console.WriteLine("Det gick bra");
}
//Runs if IndexOutOfRangeException is thrown by the try block
catch (IndexOutOfRangeException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Wrong index: {ex.Message}");
    Console.WriteLine(ex.StackTrace);
}
//Runs if FormatException is thrown by the try block
catch (FormatException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Wrong format: {ex.Message}");
    Console.WriteLine(ex.StackTrace);
}
//Runs if Exception, other than those above, is thrown by the try block
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Unexpected Error");
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    Console.WriteLine(ex.StackTrace);
}
//Always runs
finally
{
    Console.WriteLine("End of application");
}

//Nested try-blocks
static void MyFunctionTwo()
{
    try
    {
        int[] myArray = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
        myArray[4] = 0;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error in MyFunctionTwo: {ex.Message}");
        //Trows exception again
        throw;
    }
    
}

//Will handle two exceptions
try
{
    try
    {
        
        MyFunctionTwo();
        Int32.Parse("Hej");
    }
    catch (IndexOutOfRangeException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"IndexOutOfRangeException: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error: {ex.Message}");
}
//Throws chosen exception type
throw new FileNotFoundException();
```

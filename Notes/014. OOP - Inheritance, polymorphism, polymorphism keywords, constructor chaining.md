# 014. OOP - Inheritance, polymorphism, polymorphism keywords, constructor chaining


## Inheritance
In C# you can only inherit from one class.

All classes inherits from System.Object
Methods: GetType(), GetHashCode(), ToString(), ReferenceEquals(), Equals()

Is-A relationship - when making a class, it has a relationship to parent classes all the way up to System.Object

### Keywords
Protected - as private, but is inherited by sub class.

Example:
```c#
class Animal
{
	//Properties
	public Name;
	protected Age;
	
	//Methods:
	public Eat();
	private Dream();
}
	//A Mammal class that inherits from Animal:
	class Mammal
	{
		/* Inherited
		public Name;
		protected Age;
		public Eat()
		*/
		public Run()
	}
		//A Cat class that inherits from Mammal
		class Cat
		{
			/* Inherited
			public Name;
			protected Age;
			public Eat()	
			public Run()
			*/
			public Miaow()
		}
		//A Dog class that inherits from Mammal
		class Cat
		{
			/* Inherited
			public Name;
			protected Age;
			public Eat()	
			public Run()
			*/
			public Bark()
		}
	//A Bird class that inherits from Animal:
	class Bird
	{
		/* Inherited
		public Name;
		protected Age;
		public Eat()
		*/
		public Fly()
	}
		//A Parrot class that inherits from Bird
		class Parrot
		{
			/* Inherited
			public Name;
			protected Age;
			public Eat()	
			public Fly()
			*/
			public Talk()
		}
```

## Polymorphism

**Static polymorphism** - Overloading

**Dynamic polymorphism** - Override 

Keywords
Override - an own implementation of inherited method.

Virtual - used in class definition to make a method able to override when inherited.

Abstract - Used to make a class that can't have object instances. Also can be used for members to make all subclasses need to have a implementation of the method even though the class that defines the abstract member doesn't have an implementation.

Base - reference to the base class

Example:
```c#
abstract class Animal
{
    //required = The required member must be declared when instanced.
    required public string Name { get; set; }
    //Abstract methods can't have a implementation of method in the class. They MUST be 
    //implemented in sub classes.
    public abstract void Run();
    //Virtual makes method overrideable.
    public virtual void Walk()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Name} is walking.");
    }
}

class Cat : Animal
{

    public void Mew()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Name}: Meow!");
    }
    //override = Make a implementation of abstract, virtual or overrided method
    public override void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The cat {Name} is running!");
    }
    public override void Walk()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Name} is walking like a cat.");
        //Calls the animal's walk method.
        base.Walk();
    }
}
```

## Cast
Tell the compiler how to treat a point in memory
```c#
Char myChar = 'A';
Console.WriteLine((int)myChar); //Output: 65 (Unicode equivalent)

Animal myAnimal = new Cat() { Name = "Rolf" };
Cat myCat = (Cat)myAnimal;
myCat.Mew();
```

## Is
Make a bool with classes
```c#
foreach (Animal animal in animals)
{
    if (animal is Dog)
    {
        Dog doggy = (Dog)animal;
        dog.Bark();
    }
    //Short form
    if (animal is Cat catty)
    {
        catty.Mew();
    }
}
```

## As 
Almost as casting, but returns null if it's not able to run.

```c#
foreach (Animal animal in animals)
{
	//if animal is dog, it will be able to bark. Using nullreference operator ensures no runtime errors.
    (animal as Dog)?.Bark();
}
```

## Constructor chaining 

In defining constructor overloads, you can build upon other constructors to avoid repeating yourself.

```c#
class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }

    public Person(string firstName, string lastName, string title) : this(firstName, lastName)
    {
        Title = title;
    }
    public Person(string firstName, string lastName) : this(firstName)
    {
        LastName = lastName;
    }
    public Person(string firstName)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
    }
}

class Student : Person
{
    public double Grade { get; set; }

    public Student(string firstName, string lastName, string title, double grade)       : base(firstName, lastName, title)
    {
        Grade = grade;
    }
}
```
